# GitHub Search App



This JavaScript application searches GitHub for users
by name and displays the results on the screen. Clicking on a specific user will
show all the repositories for that user.

1. The `index.html` file has a form with a search input. When the form is
   submitted, it should take the value of the input and search GitHub for user
   matches using the [User Search Endpoint](#user-search-endpoint).
2. Using the results of the search, display information about the users to the
   page. (You might include showing their username, avatar and a link to their
   profile.)
3. Clicking on one of these users sends a request to the
   [User Repos Endpoint](#user-repos-endpoint) and returns data about all the
   repositories for that user.
4. Using the response from the Users Repos Endpoint, all the
   repositories for that user on the page are displayed.
